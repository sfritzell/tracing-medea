# Tracing Medea

*Tracing Medea* is an animated archive of performances, places, and identity structures built on the values of visualization and mapping methodologies. *Tracing Medea* offers a digital spatio-cultural journey of the reception of Euripides’ *Medea*, one of the most widely staged and adapted ancient Greek tragedies in the modern world. Medea has been characterized as the most theatrical of all Greek tragic characters and a heroine who has been fascinating audiences for more than two thousand years. The complexity of her ethnic, social, and gendered identity, her Otherness, character, actions, and tragic story have long inspired the imagination of artists worldwide, sparking discussions on matters of inclusivity and belonging.
